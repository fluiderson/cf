//! AM-internal mapping from the SDK `IdP` failure shapes to
//! [`crate::domain::error::DomainError`].
//!
//! The trait + DTO are stable contract and live in
//! [`account_management_sdk::idp`] (see that module's docs for the
//! provisioner contract). This module owns the **mapping** from those
//! plugin-facing failure variants onto AM's internal error taxonomy:
//!
//! * [`From<account_management_sdk::ProvisionFailure>`] → [`DomainError`]
//! * [`From<account_management_sdk::DeprovisionFailure>`] → [`DomainError`]
//!
//! Both conversions redact provider-supplied detail strings (which can
//! carry vendor SDK error text, hostnames, or token-bearing fragments)
//! through [`redact_provider_detail`] and emit a `tracing::warn!` on
//! `am.idp` so operators can correlate the redacted public envelope
//! back to the raw provider response via the digest + length pair.

/// Stable, non-secret correlation handle for a provider-supplied error
/// detail. The raw text can carry vendor SDK strings, hostnames, or
/// token-bearing fragments — even into operator logs (which have a
/// longer retention horizon than the request envelope) those values
/// must not surface verbatim. Operators correlate the hash + length
/// across `am.idp` log events and audit rows; the inverse mapping
/// stays inside the audit-only `Internal::diagnostic` field where
/// access is governed by the audit-storage policy.
///
/// FNV-1a is chosen over [`std::hash::DefaultHasher`] because the
/// stdlib hasher's algorithm is explicitly unspecified and may change
/// between Rust toolchain versions — that would silently desync
/// digests emitted by older binaries from the same input hashed in a
/// newer one, breaking the cross-upgrade correlation a forensic
/// handle exists for. FNV-1a is spec-pinned, so a digest emitted
/// today still matches one emitted next year against the same input.
/// Collision resistance is not a concern here (non-cryptographic;
/// the inverse mapping lives in the audit-only `diagnostic` field).
///
/// We feed the bytes directly via [`Hasher::write`] rather than the
/// [`Hash`] trait because `Hash::hash` for `str` has no documented
/// stability guarantee across compiler versions (the std docs
/// explicitly warn that the byte stream `Hash` produces "should not
/// be considered stable between compiler versions"). FNV-1a being
/// spec-pinned only protects the *algorithm*; the cross-upgrade
/// digest stability we promise above also requires a spec-pinned
/// *encoding* of the input. UTF-8 bytes from `as_bytes()` are that
/// stable encoding. Length is reported in `chars` to keep the public
/// log field a Unicode-grapheme-aligned magnitude, while the digest
/// commits to the byte sequence one-to-one.
