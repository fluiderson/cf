//! Tenant repository contract.
//!
//! `TenantRepo` is the sole storage-seam the domain layer touches. It
//! abstracts the SeaORM-backed implementation so `TenantService` can be
//! unit-tested against a pure in-memory fake.
//!
//! Trait-method shape notes:
//!
//! * Every write path that changes closure rows is expressed as a single
//!   repo method that performs the `tenants` + `tenant_closure` writes in
//!   one transaction. The service never opens a transaction itself.
//! * The `activate_tenant` method corresponds to saga step 3 from
//!   DESIGN §3.3 `seq-create-child`: flip the tenant from `provisioning`
//!   to `active` AND insert the closure rows passed by the service.
//! * `compensate_provisioning` is the clean-failure compensation path;
//!   closure cleanup is not required because no closure rows are ever
//!   written while the tenant is in `provisioning`.
//! * `update_tenant_mutable` only accepts the patchable fields (name +
//!   status) and rewrites `tenant_closure.descendant_status` atomically
//!   when `status` changes.

/// Read / write boundary for the `tenants` + `tenant_closure` tables.

/// query builders.
///
/// # Caller contract on `scope`
///
/// Both `tenants` and `tenant_closure` entities are declared
/// `no_tenant, no_resource, no_owner, no_type`. On these declarations
/// `Scopable::IS_UNRESTRICTED` is `false` and every constraint
/// property resolves to `None`, which means:
///
/// * `scope_with(allow_all())` → no-op (no `WHERE` clause added).
/// * `scope_with(<narrowed>)` → `deny_all()` (`WHERE false`) for reads
///   / mutations, and `ScopeError::Denied` for INSERTs.
///
/// **Until `InTenantSubtree` lands**, callers MUST pass
/// [`AccessScope::allow_all`]. A narrowed scope silently zero-rows
/// every read and turns every mutation into a no-op or hard deny —
/// no useful authorization happens at this boundary today.
/// Cross-tenant authorization is enforced one layer up by the PDP
/// gate in the service layer.
///
/// # Future: subtree clamp via `InTenantSubtree`
///
/// Subtree clamp on `tenants` reads will land via a dedicated
/// `InTenantSubtree` predicate type (mirror of the existing
/// `InGroupSubtree` stack) — scoped as a separate PR in this stack
/// between the AM service PR and the Tenant Resolver Plugin PR.
/// After that lands, AM declares the `tenant_hierarchy` capability
/// and the PDP returns `InTenantSubtree(root=subject.tenant_id)`
/// constraints which the secure builder compiles to a JOIN on
/// `tenant_closure`. At that point the `scope` parameter starts
/// carrying meaningful narrowing and the impl-side `scope_with`
/// calls begin to apply auto-filter; this docstring will be updated
/// to drop the "MUST pass `allow_all`" requirement.
