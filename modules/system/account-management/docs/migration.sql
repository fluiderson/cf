-- Reference DDL for the Account Management source-of-truth schema.
-- This file is intentionally documentation-first: implementation migrations may
-- express the same logical schema through ModKit/SeaORM migration code.
-- Dialect: PostgreSQL reference DDL.
-- Retention policy overview:
--   conversion_requests: soft-deleted (`deleted_at` stamped) by the AM retention
--     job after `resolved_retention` (default 30d) elapses past the terminal
--     status transition; hard-deleted on AM's platform retention cadence.
--   tenants: soft-deleted via `tenants.deleted_at`; hard-deleted by the
--     background tenant-hard-delete job after the tenant retention window and
--     precondition checks (no non-deleted children, no RG ownership references).
--   tenant_closure: rows for a tenant are removed only on tenant hard-delete.
--     Provisioning tenants are never present (see comment on descendant_status).

That yields 15 usable flag bits (bits 0..14); the sign bit (bit 15) is unavailable because a value with bit 15 set overflows the signed positive range and/or trips the CHECK. 15 flag bits remain ample for the multi-dimensional barrier types contemplated in TENANT_MODEL.md, and SMALLINT stays portable across PostgreSQL and MySQL without dialect-specific type mapping.

Inherited resolution is performed at READ time by the application-layer `MetadataService::resolve` (DESIGN §3.2 MetadataService), which walks the `parent_id` ancestor chain and stops at self-managed barriers for `inherit` schemas. Direct SQL readers that bypass `MetadataService` will therefore see only directly-written values — this is deliberate (ADR-0002: walk-up read resolution, no write amplification) and is the reason there is no CHECK/trigger/materialized inheritance on this table.';
